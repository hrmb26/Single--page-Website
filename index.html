                <p><b>Oberith Rosenbach</b>, who would later become known as the founder of this place, commanded an army of priestesses. They used their holy singing voices and power of light to protect their allies and the innocent.

                    These priestesses were once victims of the <b>Black Order</b>. At a time before <b>Oberith</b> became the Fourth Priestess, she singlehandedly took on the leaders of the <b>Black Order</b> to save them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The corrupt members of the <b>Black Order</b> watched with a smile on their faces as the young girls screamed in fear and pain, covered in the blood of Imposters. Some of them hung on crosses. Without hesitation, <b>Oberith</b> charged into the scene and cut down dozens of heretics, saving the girls. She even built a new home for them.

                <h1>SHAMAN</h1>
                <p>
                    These women are in small numbers, but they can be seen all over the world.
                    They are selfless and affable, but they don't like to talk about their pasts. It is said that the Shamans are—or were—members of the Order of Remidia, or have something to do with it, and that claim is backed by the remarkable healing power that they have revealed time and again.
                </p>                   
                <p>
                    That's not, however, what makes them who they are. It's the Shamans. These Shamans are similar to the revelations of the Order, but while the revelations are based on the believers' faith, the Shamans are more dependent on the soothsayers. One must meet special qualifications to receive these Shamans, and these qualifications vary, depending on the god who gives them.
                </p>
            <!-- These Shamans worship the Sacred Dragon and there aren't many things known about this particular god. Based on the words of those who witnessed their rituals, I suspect he's one of the famous deities and mythical creatures of Suju. All the witnesses claimed that watching the rituals cleared their heads and cured mild illnesses. Such a phenomenon is popular among the worshippers of the Suju deities. -->

                <h1>MISTRESS</h1>
                <p>
                    A priestess prayed to God to forgive the sins of man. She begged him to let her carry the others' sin for them. When her prayer was answered, she received stigmata, the symbol of her new power that God gave her, so she could draw demons out of Hell and punish them in His name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her stigmata resembled the Seven Deadly Sins. Sinners called it God's curse and avoided her at all costs. Whenever she went, demons that hid among men couldn't help but reveal their true forms. These demons were ripped into pieces by her hands and sent back to the bottomless pit where they belonged.
                    People called this method of revealing demons the Mistress phenomenon, which coined her name, the Mistress.                        
                    <!-- Rumor has it that the Mistress was one of the girls who were forever marked by the Black Order before they were saved by Remidia Kathedra. There was a heated debate among the leaders of Remidia over the treatment of these girls, but in the end, it was decided that the victims should not be punished for what was done unto them, and that there shouldn't be any more discussion or questions as to their marks, which were believed to symbolize Original Sin. -->
